# Prototype Engine
This is the prototype engine of my own.\
Have fun exploring it, catch some nice snippets (or bugs) if that's your jam.\
It's just an attempt to build a 3d engine, don't use this for production or anything like that.\
This could be good for anyone who wants to get started.\
I am adding more things to this repository bit by bit when I feel like they're good to go.\
This is a toy project, nothing here is to be taken seriously.

# Run PrototypeEngine
- Use it in your browser without installing anything
  - [PrototypeEngine web-app link](https://prot.d3jtpgbafxbwuz.amplifyapp.com/)
- Use the Windows 10 pre-built binaries directly without compiling anything
  - Download latest release
- Compile it from source
  - See the build from source instructions below

# Build from source instructions
```
‚ö†Ô∏è TAKES { TIME + DISK SPACE } (~ 70 GB) TO CLONE AND BUILD ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
